'cause he ain't got nobody to listen
deep down i must have always known
is this the place we used to love
yeah yeah thats it honey
nobody told me that you'd be here
bring the floor up to my knees
i wouldnt be wishing i was free
but he stays all the same
sure she's got it all
soaking it all up for fun
but theres a side to you
cause everybody wants something from me
you will only be eternally
i dont want to live in chaos
can i get it
whenever i'm alone with you
when im struggling to feel at all
when you don't yeah
please dont fall apart
but oh my oh my
'cause we had time against us
this ain't easy it's not meant to be
dont leave me on this stretch alone
let time be patient
lo passo mai insieme ate
i never woulda loaded up a forty four
bound by the surprise of our glory days
and everyone agrees
were not the only ones
cause mine sure wont be shared
i have a blue house with a blue window
so can i get it right now mh
are the wonders of my world
i never woulda hitch hiked to birmingham
if you need a friend or a lover
i don't want to live in chaos
so stand beside the river i cried
i swear to god i am such a mess
the scars of your love remind me of us
tell a story that i cannot bear to hear
you cant make your heart feel
just look & you will see
'round my hometown
but you can't fight fire with fire ahh
and be thankful when it's done
i'm willing to take the risk
i miss you i miss you
next time i'll be braver
i'll be waiting
wish that i would let you break my walls
to whisper will you leave your man 
the sight of you is dramatic
i'd go crawling down the avenue
there's never been a better time
and even in the dark
all the things youd say
its so cold out here in your wilderness
and if i stay i'll be alive
i swear i'm dead in the eyes ooh ooh ooh
i cant go back to the river
but you played it you played it
it's like they're scared of me
cause it was not said to you
i've seen your face under every sky
just take it take it all with you
who regrets the things theyve done
'cause i love
if you're not the one for me
at least i know he's lying still
this feeling won't last mm ooh ooh ooh
do do do do ohh ohh yeah
and making up the past
'cause heart break and hearts wait
id go crawling
then our eyes cry and souls sigh
what you see i see
when night comes & you're on your own
if youd consider what we shared
youre so provocative im so conservative
ive been trying my whole life to solve
i dont have to explain myself to you
yours too baby come on now
to put the pieces of me back together
se non ci fossi tu
i don't have to explain myself to you
shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
of a person we don't even like
let this be our lesson in love
when i walk in a room im invisible
you couldve had it all
out of all the people in the world
but when i call you never
i want you
why dont you remember dont you remember
i know there is no tomorrow
when i wake up i'm afraid 
they cant look me in the eye
haven't made
for you too don't forget me
everything just takes me back
than you ever did me before
i want to get on the next flight home
'cause he won't go
tell me to run and i'll race
are the wonders of this world
please stop calling me its exhausting
is there anyone i could call
if youre not the one for me
i created this storm
if you're ready i am ready
you said i'm stubborn & i never give in
hold your breath and count to ten
no we aint kids no more
in every face that i've ever known
i know id never be me
that terrific rainbow over you and me
morning will come
i wouldn't be wishing i was free
didnt i do it right to let you down
when i'm struggling to feel at all
at least that id know that youre okay
i thought you loved me more than this
i know you haven't made your mind up yet
i need to get away to feel again
we both know we ain't kids no more
but we do doo doo doo but we do
painting pictures with my mind
that i call home
they've all been said before you know
a thousand miles & poles apart
rumor has it rumor
even though everything's a strain
that i never knew never knew
you say it's all in my head
baby i'm so rising
god only knows what we're fighting for
watched it pour as i touched your face
i will lay down my heart
my heart so bad it cuts through
its in my roots its in my veins
i know i left you speechless
on this endless game
i will beg and ill steal i will borrow
you know ill always mean
about the things i can't control
just what i'm hoping for
tell me to run & i'll race
i promise im worth it
you know my heart more than i do
but you played it
when night comes and im all on my own
i'm okay i'm okay yes i am
forgive me first love but im tired
so watch them turn to dust
you've burnt my heart to stone
or a place that you can hide
my hands theyre strong
turns me crazy
i saw a boy that looked like you
baby please remember me once more
i was so young that it was hard to know
you played it to the beat
and the whole world is on your case
throw your soul through every open door
i will be i will be
youre the wiser one disguised from greed
you ain't seen nothing like me yet
im tired of this empty house
turn down these voices
you shower me with words made of knives
i'd go hungry
because im too crazy for you
cause you feel like home
under haunted skies i see you
when i walk around all of the streets
you're gonna wish you never had met me
it was just like a movie
and make me crazy for you
ooh ooh ooh
where i grew up & found my feet
youve been on my mind
hold you in
whos truly satisfied
i'm a red hot mama but i'm blue for you
the sweetest devotion i've known
it was in the darkest of my days
lights go down lights go down
i can't help feeling
can't have you the way
where i grew up and found my feet
e non importa che io senta per te
i'll stand still & let the storm pass by
doesnt tear you apart anymore
oh what have i done yet again
and i ain't asking for forgiveness
every word ive said
she sang
until the end starts
youre the right kind of madness
yes i swam dirty waters
looks like i was wrong
the only regret i have
pull me in hold me tight
youre my light youre my darkness
i'm finding it hard to be here sincerely
when i dont get nothing back
no you wont
per me il mondo finira
go ahead & still it's not steal my heart
i'll be somebody different
dont pretend that you dont want me
i'd go crawling
blue like my corvette it's in & outside
cause what if i never love again
its a sacrifice but i cant live a lie
i know you
i won't let you close enough to hurt me
it's like a ride that i want to get off
i'm trying to be brave
but at least when your at your worst
im blue da ba dee da ba daa
i aint got too much time to spare
its harder when your on top
you when you dont yeah yeah
when i sing along with you
the morning rain the morning rain
i could make you happy
there's so many shades of black
so little to say but so much time
that this would be inevitable
youll never know if you never try
i'm the only one in love
let the sky fall
when will you run with me
whatever it takes
we gotta let go of all of our ghosts
is the answer to it all
dont you like me
i promise i'm worth it
we wont be making up
i cant even cry ooh ooh ooh
maybe i should leave to help you see
this feeling wont last mm ooh ooh ooh
i need a drink to get me out
but ive heard one on you
i'm my own worst enemy
well it felt something died
i say weve only known each other a year
i'm hanging by a thread
mama's got a lot to learn teach me
but they don't recognize me now
even now when we're already over
all night long
im tired of trying
i must've called a thousand times
if im wrong i am right
and im forever excusing your intentions
and its bringing me out the dark
cause i knew that that was
that ive been washin my hands in forever
cause you dont care hmm
my heart speaks in puzzle & codes
we come from the same place
and a part of me keeps holding on
lay down with me
one glimpse & i panic inside
when i lay with you
id settle for a busy tone
i said lord dont let me let me down
and pull me to the light
i don't think you quite understand
everything you got
when i don't get nothing back
i heard that you're settled down
i don't know and i feel 
its been waiting for you to open up
theres such a difference between us
and tell me no lies
that i will be i will be your remedy oh
let it be known that i cried for you
it drags as i lose my mind
i won't say a word
baby let me in
i have a girlfriend & she is so blue
i know it's hard but it's not
standing on my own two feet
oh i hope that someday i'll learn
listen i know how low i can go
yeah theres many shades of black
hold your breath & count to ten
have i ever asked for much
i want every single piece of you
blue is the color of all that i wear
im holdin on catch me
there's nothing that i wouldn't do
to the beat
just cause you heard it
thats why i dream about you
dont look back at this crumbling fool
just 'cause you heard it
are you crazy
its so cold in your wilderness
how come weve both become a version
when you dont yeah
look dont get me wrong
hello how are you
but the more i do
if you see me coming
i can't do it on my own
he cant do it on his own
with you and me setting the tone
we will stand tall
think well never match at all but we do
theres only one way down
and neon lights & waiting papers
regrets & mistakes their memories made
and even then you dont get far
no room in my bed
could have had it all
we both know we aint kids no more
i will beg and i'll steal i will borrow
usually i'm best alone
waits for you
no you won't
i don't wanna be cruel or vicious
i cant help feeling
yeah that's it honey
oh i'd do anything
when i'm out at a party
slow how you wanted it to be
but it's in my roots it's in my veins
but like everything ive ever known
soaking up the sun
can i get it right now mhm
ooh the people i've met yeah
maybe were already defeated
until you kissed my lips & you saved me
i let my heart decide the way
i felt the branches of it looking at me
like i'm the one for you
i will change if i must
as much as it did then
all of these words whispered in my ear
and ill tread any dangerous road
but i wont go
so hello from the other side other side
just hold me close dont patronize
i wont stand by you
for everything that i've done
say it ain't so say it ain't so
she is half your age
do dily di da da da da day yeah
ill always love you
there is something in your loving
in a summer haze bound by the surprise
oh id do anything
like how
come on and give me a chance
let me photograph you in this light
and i see my future in you
and a blue corvette
alone & face to face
cause he aint got nobody to listen
no & thank you please madam
ive drowned & dreamt this moment
why do you steal my hand
was all in place
everybody taking different sides
please stay where you are
the only thing that i want is your love
thats not fair
i ain't lost just wandering
with your loving there ain't nothing
but you wont no you wont
they make believe that everything
to nurture what ive done
you're still strong are still strong
i'll be my own savior
but i want to live
it feels like we're oceans apart
hoping youll walk through
i've been looking for you baby
to scratch my itch and beat my drum
you ain't seen nothing
heavens cried
but there's a side to you
what ill say is
just look and you will see
bring your heart i'll bring my soul
in the light of day
that's not fair
when im stumbling in the dark for a hand
cant say that its been that great
i only wanted to have fun
so overdue i owe them
as far as im concerned
where worlds collide and days are dark
you and me together
tonight i throw myself in two
ive cried my heart out
youre all that i need
with his hands behind his back oh
memories are fresh
and fly around in circles
i'm a fool for that
if this is ain't love then what is
ill do everything different
and you played it to the beat
go to the ends of the earth for you
think we'll never match at all
i had hoped youd see my face
they were never true never true
i wasnt ready then im ready now
something that it wont
oh simple thing where have you gone
i guess we're like water & a flame
its already in your eyes
rumor has it
and bear my soul
'cause we are living worlds apart
oh i hope that someday ill learn
can i have a moment
'cause everybody wants something from me
how unbelievable unbelievable
feeling up his girl
you & me together
i dont regret a thing
walking with each other
if i've been on your mind
oh anymore
which forgive you each time

i cant bear this time
closer & near
then sees you through
before i go
oh i'm movin' on
i find it funny that youre the only
please stop calling me it's exhausting
let me fall into your gravity
the night
i ain't got too much time to spare
give me a memory i can use
so we can love each other for free
but we do doo doo doo doo doo ah oh
feels like were both none the wiser
yeah theres any shades of black
we were born & raised
and without your love im hollow yeah
ye that's it baby
just in case it hasnt gone
turn oh no no
he is a real lover
you'll never know if you never try
baby i quit
i cant keep up with your turning tables
i had no time to choose

if youve got someone else
how can you not see

ya da hey hey hey hey
forgive me first love but i'm tired
love will soon come
when night comes and youre on your own
the things i had planned
but i can't bring myself to swim
never woulda loaded up a forty four
and i'm sure my eyes they speak for me
you're the only one that i want
please forgive me for my sins
blew me away
every story has its scars
an you showed up
the last time
usually im best alone
there is so much space between us
but youll never have my heart
cant have you the way
it's the sweetest
everlong
a girl like you aint meant to go away
find balance in the sacrifice
so just hold on ooh ooh
i forgive you once again
that terrific rainbow over you & me
every now and then my memories ache
don't you know i've fallen for you
hello can you hear me
what a thing to do
i heard you've been missing me

im willing to take the risk
i let it fall my heart
i gotta go
why do you feel like that
id go hungry id go black and blue
you played it
and i'll do what's right
i wont say a word
simply its tiring
im giving you up
theres nothing else i want
not that i care i dont care
now you're gone
but you pushed me in
now youre gone
walking with each other 
when im out at a party
like him inside and outside
you set me free
i know im not the only one
means we can break every law
you & i have history
hello from the outside outside
just be gracious
it's harder when your on top
if you dont choose to grow
talk about it somewhere only we know
feels like we're both none the wiser
they say that time's supposed to heal ya
that probably doesnt even show
or hide from the light
ma ti pensavo sempre
and everything is blue for him
if it hadn't been for love
god only knows why it's taken me 
god only knows how i've cried
what have i done
when night comes and you're on your own
down the avenue
i wish nothing but the best
go ahead & still my heart
but good to catch
cause ive been by myself all night long
when you're in doubt
but youd save the best for last
and fall
in this situation i'll be glad
i know youve got things to do i do too
and the stars appear
everybody wants something
look don't get me wrong
blue like my corvette its in and outside
your teasing aint enough
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
regrets and mistakes their memories made
in hope that you find the missing piece
even if it leads nowhere yeah
go easy on me baby
i saw what my heart can really do
and dream next to you
over every border & on every line
and he could change the world
my dignity is become undone
and the games you play
and have you tell me
or at least as far as i thought i knew
but nothing will never taint us
than i ever did you before
we're not the only ones
but it don't matter it clearly
but you will never give it up
it matters how this ends
the dream that i sell dream i sell
'cause it will never hurt
feels like we're both none the wiser ahh
didn't i give it all
that i can't adore
waiting as my heart drops
its where they make you feel powerful
though your kisses
say whats on your mind
baby im calling for you
pacing floors and opening doors
you make it look like i'm see through
i cant do it on my own
guess she gave you things
i hoped youd see my face
but i set fire to the rain
one glimpse and i panic inside
all love is devout
dont let go baby give me light
i've imagined it all
and if you have a minute why dont we go
without falling to your feet
i cant keep up cant keep up cant keep up
or scared of having nothing left
i wont ask you you to just desert me
just take it all with my love
i look away i look away
no one knows me like you do
what i'll say is
feels like were both none the wiser ahh
if it hadnt been for love
i'm holdin' on catch me
you when you don't yeah yeah
i wish youd come over
you know mommy doesn't like 
never mind ill find someone like you
to make you feel my love oh yes
i'd go hungry i'd go black & blue
but be delicate with my ego
let me let me just come & get it
sometimes i wake up by the door
oh at all
its about time that i face myself
hearts break and hearts wait
before it's too late
the way i'm running with you honey
i know that youve been hurt before
it's already in your eyes
ive drowned and dreamt this moment
you hang on every word i say
cause then i dont see
had no time to choose
you think we would & we do
if i am im crazy for you
plus hes there for you
old friend why are you so shy
but we couldn't see eye to eye
my little love
but go on go on take it take it all you
'cause heart break & hearts wait
when we were both right
you can't make your heart feel
this could be the end of everything
cause this is trouble but it feels right
hear my heart burst again
you played it you played it
there's only one way down
nobody knows it better than me
i'm so hard to impress
she made your heart melt
that you and i are wrong
i miss my mother i miss it when
she is a stranger
each & every time i turn around to leave
love will soon come baby
now i'm resemblance to the man i met
making memories using my eyes
yes i do & always loved you
your remedy mmm hmm mmm hmm
mornin will come and ill do whats right
your body standing over me
i look away i will look away
i've changed my mind
it turns out it ain't enough
i had no idea of the state we were in
if you don't
i cant take another defeat
sat by the river and it made me complete
all because i wanted
when you dont
didnt i give it all
don't patronize me
all this sorrow and this pain
i dont know why im scared
love is a game for fools to play
that i wouldnt do
i've been here before
out of my head i sang
and kiss me back to life to see
i promise i'm worthy 
forgive me first love but im too tired
we were sad of getting old
so long to let my doubts go
blue his house with a blue little window
cause i love you
strangers by nature
its better when something is wrong
somebody smeared
and hold you tight
i can't face your breaking heart
why do i hate the idea of being free
if you don't choose to grow
and now you've gone & changed your mind
i get closer you obviously prefer her
how can one become so bounded
oh oh no
stop asking me to stay
for the big one for the big jump
when we were younger & free
and the highest hopes
could it be the brightest star
youre still not mentioning love
love you
i heard that your dreams came true
you look like a movie
i call that home
well its a battle that i cannot fight
some say ill be better without you
that was what you told me
god only knows why its taken me 
but instead i fall back to my knees
when we used
when night comes & i'm all on my own
i heard youve been missing me
this is the end
everybody loves the things you do
right here right now
you made a fool out of you
if i'm in love with you
never mind i'll find someone like you
and if i'm not the one for you
and the games youd play
everybody wants something from me
i want to feel my heartbeat so
i'd go hungry i'd go black and blue
you know i you know im gonna do it
you said im crazy
and put myself behind a jailhouse door
like a joke or a memory
out i'm still trying to stay inside
i had hoped you'd see my face
i'm just excited to get home
the reason you loved me before
i aint yours for no taking
your love is useless without it
just how good this could be
one more time
'cause what if i never love again
i'll close my eyes then i won't see
ill always yearn if i never speak
oh yea a a oh oh oh oh oh
he wont go
lay down with me tell me no lies
soltanto una notte ancor
let pain be gracious 
i dont need your honesty
of my world yeah
if you just hold on mm
hes willing to take the risk
hello from the other side other side
so thats it baby
we were the greatest me and you
could describe him
someone else
but i found a boy who i love more
you know mommy doesnt like 
these final hours
haven't you heard the rumors
dont come any closer
il tempo passa senza che
but give it to yourself now
under your thumb i can't breathe
mmh mhm mhm mhm mm
no i won't rescue you to just desert me
no i won't ask you you to just desert me
i know there is hope in these waters
it only makes it harder baby harder baby
cause theres a side to you
favoritism aint my thing but 
cause i knew that that was 
to tell you im sorry
for you & i together here
i'm so afraid but i'm open wide
boy you give good love i wont lie
all night
i quit im movin on
who would have known how bittersweet
the only thing ill ever ask of you
but you won't
oh im movin on
we had a date
you get the people & the government
you know how to feel things
every time he ain't here
and if your mind is made up
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
no i wont rescue you to just desert me
it'll clean your face
don't forget me i begged
every word i've said
fire burning and its lighting me up
can i get it right now
crazy for you
the sweetest devotion
out of your head
this ain't lust
something that it won't
and im sure my eyes they speak for me
all i do is bleed into someone else
so darling
boy im tired of trying
i'm movin' on
your mind up yet
there's no way i
treat me soft but touch me cool
nothing is better
he won't go
hearts break & hearts wait
with eyes that make you melt
you're the one for me
dont forget me i begged
finally i can see you crystal clear
all my life
let it out let it all out
i don't regret a thing
ooh aah oh
that i cant adore
to give up this fight
you give up everything you are
if this ain't love then what is
close enough to start a war
from all my tears
i'll always yearn if i never speak
round my hometown
when you dont ooh dont
thats why you feel so insecure
theyve all been said before you know
when i wake up im afraid 
i heard his voice today
it only makes it harder baby
but they dont recognize me now
now that it's over
if i tell the world
so wipe that dirty smile off
say that its always been me
i didn't get the chance to
hello it's me
closer and near
id always kiss
ill be better for you
you're half me and you're half daddy
oh honey
cause i love
go ahead
people say crazy things
couldn't stay away i couldn't fight it
cause when hard work dont pay off
how can i help lift you
you say its all in my head
what are you waiting for
we were born and raised in a summer haze
and a million miles
ive forgiven it all
when i found a boy who loves me more
hold me like im more than just a friend
is going to go away
its hard to admit that
looks good when he walks
can't say that it's been that great
all of my life
don't forget me i beg
to dry your tears
hold on you just hold on just hold on
my skins paper thin i cant stop wavering
when we were young
what i chose to do
fire burning & it's lighting me up
i won't ask you you to just desert me
sure shes got it all
theres nothing that i wouldnt do
it's been there for days on end and
don't need to look no further
but you wont
i get lost in our hours
ooh the people ive met yeah
i won't go i can't do it on my own
no one knows what its like to be us
we were the greatest me & you
im so afraid but im open wide
missing out the cracks in the pavement
and be thankful when its done
never woulda hitch hiked to birmingham
our hearts break & hearts wait
from people i don't even know
filling up my heart with golden stories
and im counting on you on you
darling this is goodbye
i find it funny that you're the only
this love has dried up & stayed behind
but you cant fight fire with fire ahh
baby i'm calling for you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
our love ain't water under the bridge
you & me together nothing gets better
watch you wave
and that's exactly what i need to do
whenever you look at me i wish i was her
that i will be i will be your remedy
woke up feeling heavy hearted
nei sogni tu con me
id build myself up
or don't you remember
think well never match at all
out of my life & into your arms
to forget your past & simply be mine
ive changed my mind
i don't see you
where worlds collide & days are dark
come down & waste away with me
cause i found a boy who i love more
didn't i do it right to let you down
so why dont we go
put myself behind a jailhouse door
water and a flame
who you have on your hands
rumor has it rumor rumor
cause i only want to be the cure
and you played it
it's been waiting for you to open up
i can't even cry ooh ooh ooh
take your eyes off of me so i can leave
the love i have for you
and there is no one there
and for what and for what and for what
they don't know you like i do
inside my head
we won't be making up
making a home down there
so tell me when youre gonna let me in
a warm embrace
even though everythings a strain
come on & give me the chance
but dont you remember dont you remember
i'm as lost now as i was back then
it's been nearly an hour
and i will give up this fight
and as it fell you rose to claim it
but its you who makes me lose my head
that i will be i will be i will be
in this situation ill be glad
she made a fool out of you
they can't look me in the eye
see how i leave with every piece of you
let pain be gracious
oy i'm tired
i built a house for love to grow
still how can you walk away
go to the ends of this earth for you
ooh the people ive met yea
build your world around me
but i know right now
i don't need your honesty
but we had time against us
i will always love you
i love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
you should know i chose to be alone
baby im so rising
i'm a fool but they all think i'm blind
for this is the end
all i ask is
have i not learned anything
there's such a difference between us
i feel very paranoid feel very stressed
you're the only one that i wanted
boy you give good love i won't lie
i'd always kiss
ooh the people ive met
time against us
but like everything i've ever known
i beg i'll remember you said
never mind said your open arms
simply it's tiring
were in love with the world
its no secret
doo yeah yea a a oh oh oh oh oh ooh
no final kiss to seal anything
sweetest
you sound like a song
i could hold you
fire burning and it's lighting me up
lose myself in time
ill never say enough
let this be the way we remember us
voglio che sai
however far away i will always love you
out of the red
that probably doesn't even show
even now when were already over
you're half me & you're half daddy
but lately
about decisions you make
water & a flame
and the more i do the less i know
its so hard to digest
so i can tell you that i was wrong
feel the world around me
you make it look like im see through
when i walk in a room i'm invisible
come on & give me a chance
i dont think you quite understand
at skyfall
and save me boy
i've never known this never before
it's harder when you're on top
and now ive had enough of love
the love you don't feel
see i can see that look in your eyes
where love is lost your ghost is found
i feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
all the things you'd say
for the very first time
im okay im okay yes i am
you & your charm creep closer
your teasing ain't enough
and himself & everybody around
yo listen up heres the story
no one knows what it's like to be us
ive known it
we play so dirty in the dark
we almost fall apart and burn up easy
it's hard to admit that
tell me to run and ill race
he's willing to take the risk
this was all you none of it me
painting walls with all my secret tears
it's a sacrifice but i can't live a lie
welcome sunrise with the morning glory
let it burn
your name
it's about time that i face myself
with every feeling every word
but i would never
there's so many ways to act
and everything you dos a game
you build me up then leave me dead
maybe baby i'm just losing my mind 
the one that shoots me each & every time
i put my heart on the line
but baby is that really what you want
it feels like were oceans apart
dont need to look no further
you dont seem
a couple more til i forget your name
seems i love the things you do
theres never been a better place
there's never been a better place
but thats your projection
im just excited to get home
im going back to where i started
if your worry bound
at least that i'd know that you're okay
throw me to the water yeah yeah
ye thats it baby
there's nothing else i want
yeah there's many shades of black
now that i see
when youre in doubt
like he's never felt a figure before
something i can cling on to
the crazier i turn into
four cold walls against my will
'cause you feel like home
i met someone by accident
ive made up my mind
everything i do is for you
i will always be there
i get excitement in your bones
even thought everythings a strain
cause i cant make you love me
skyfall is where we start
you just want me
lord have mercy on my soul
the way i want you
and now youve gone and changed your mind
is a road best left behind ahh
you can say i chose to be alone
ive seen your face under every sky
he would be hard to chase
yeah yeah hey ay
if you're ready if you're ready
from the way you talk
hoping you'll walk through
i promise i'm worthy
say that it's always been me
ill be my own savior
when the rain
hold my hand while you cut me down
dont try to change my mind
where'd you go when you stayed behind
the love you dont feel
for someone like you
miles between us
and i'd go crawling down the avenue
if ive been on your mind
cause youre still strong
i'll never say enough
that corrupt our hearts somehow
yeah there's any shades of black
in the end it's just you
i wish you'd come over
that the both of us
go to the ends
some say i'll be better without you
we're in love with the world
youre the one for me
i realized what i wanted wasnt there
but we couldnt see eye to eye
reminded by things i find
but not if you are so reckless
ill close my eyes
that love is a game for fools to play
i dont see you
i didnt know a single word he said
didn't i do it right
i know youve always been
out im still trying to stay inside
i dont know and i feel 
then our eyes cry & souls sigh
all you do is complain
ive been here before
and without your love i'm hollow yeah
it made us restless
you made a fool out of me
but at least when you're at your worst
our love aint water under the bridge
so where you been then don't go all coy
where you belong
they say to play hard you work hard
but if by chance you're here alone
close my eyes
well it's a battle that i cannot fight
they say that times supposed to heal ya
and turning my heel & strutting my feet
when he shouldn't be
reaching a fever pitch
you made me tumble
for everything that ive done
i promise im worthy
i don't want you at all
and i i i i i dont think you can save me
like i don't really know what i'm doing
and there's many shades of black
sometimes the road less traveled
i won't make the same mistake again
then i went on home to my skyscrapers
but now the sky has cleared and its blue
you still sound like a song
never woulda gone to that side of town
i'll close my eyes
a next time would be the ending of me
and thats exactly what i need to do
every now & then my memories ache
i don't know & i feel 
and boy youre bringing me down
im happy and unhappy too
i'm heading straight for you
rumor has it ooh
to bring you back to me
i see your eyes widen like an ocean
and the games you'd play
a thousand miles and poles apart
that we might be exactly like we were
that you & i are wrong
youre the only one that i want
for you and i together here
will he still love me even when hes free
i know it aint easy giving up your heart
i love the way your body moves
and miles between us
if you want me to stop i'll freeze
cause youre all ive got left
i dont wanna be cruel or vicious
in the end its just you
turning tables
here in the dark in these final hours
to hold in your arms
at least i can say that i've tried
its the sweetest
'cause i've been here before
the storms are raging
im holdin on barely
and for what & for what & for what
trust me ive learned it
your love it is my truth
just how good for you i am
tell me who do i run to
brushing past my every groove
no i wont ask you you to just desert me
chiamami amor
don't come any closer
out of my life and into your arms
running riots inside my soul
of my world
you still look like a movie
and turn me into a crumbling fool
but i cant bring myself to swim
dont need to think it over
shows that we aint gonna stand shit
towards me from across the room
that tears down my walls
you and me together nothing gets better
and though i wish that you were here
let me let me just come and get it
its like theyre scared of me
you're like a dream come true
woulda been gone like a wayward wind
i wont forgive me if i gave up trying
when the rain is blowing in your face
they dont know you like i do
im heading straight for you
im my own worst enemy
boy i'm tired of trying
everybody sees
blue are the words i say & what i think
and boy shes bringing you down
i didnt know quite what to do
i kept my distance so you would be free
are the wonders of now
do tell me why you waste our time
trying to learn to lean in to it all
'cause you're all i've got left
with no chance to win
you made me leave you
surely you know that im not easy to hold
when the thunder calls for me
'cause when hard work don't pay off
i won't forgive me if i gave up trying
ill be home soon i wont be late
i try to think of things to say
let time be patient 
i rebut all my rebuttals
i promise i'm worth it mm
this aint lust
see when hard work don't pay off
when night comes and im on my own
when the evening shadows
god only knows how ive cried
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
a million years ago
that's why i dream about you
oi i feel like you don't love me
you don't seem
cause i knew that that was the last time
when will i see you again
but i've heard one on you
like hes never felt a figure before
the life that you truly want
oh that you know
the one that i belong to
why am i obsessing
its been nearly an hour
that finally feels like home
don't leave me on this stretch alone
but if i can't have you
like a bomb before explosion
we could've had it all
yo listen up here's the story
ill be the one to catch myself this time
i could hold you for a million years
don't let go baby give me light
will he will he still remember me
ill close my eyes then i wont see
to earn my stripes id have to pay
complacency is the worst trait to have
but go on and take it take it all to you
im a fool for that
at least i can say that ive tried
let it be known known known
'cause you're still strong
mmh yeah
youre driving me away
well i hope i learn to get over myself
to keep climbing climbing climbing
seven days has gone so fast
i wont go i cant do it on my own
i'm trying to tell you just how
weve both know we aint kids no more
give me a reason to stay
should i give up
youve burnt my heart to stone
if im in love with you
a woman like me
i've waited here for you
daydreamer
let it be known
with the world that you feel leave
you know i you know i'm gonna do it
i remember you said
i miss you when the lights go out
what is the likelihood of jumping 
whichever road i choose you'll go
who wants to be right as rain
i don't care how deep or shallow yeah
send me spinning closer to you
their lipstick
because you asked me to
it's in my roots it's in my veins
you drift into my head
be in my sweats & stuff like that
when he shouldnt be
you know how the time flies
i guess she gave you things
with you & me setting the tone
bring your heart ill bring my soul
whenever im standing my own ground
you make me feel like i am young again
i was still a child
even thought everything's a strain
if youre ready if youre ready
i heard that youre settled down
ooh the people i've met
be in my sweats and stuff like that
turn my sorrow into treasured gold
where nothing ever happened
every day feels like the road i'm on
can i get it right now can i get it
'cause you possess powers i can't fight
i've forgiven it all
just give me till then
oh they smeared it
no theres nothing that i wouldnt do
take it all with my love
do you hang on every word i say
like me yet
i said lord don't let me let me down
hello from the outside
painting pictures
that you are in my life
i can love i can love again
i'll do everything different
baby i can take a lot
and id go crawling down the avenue
i know that it's wrong
i didnt get the chance to
im trying to tell you just how
ill never learn if i never leap
that i will be your remedy
no there's nothing that i wouldn't do
yeah yeah that's it honey
are throwing wild & free
id go hungry
no and thank you please madam
regrets & mistakes they're memories made
though winds of change
and ignore the right
nobody told me that youd be here
think we'll never match at all but we do
and all i can do is watch & cry
and the whole world
you had my heart inside of your hands
so if you got
you aint seen nothing like me yet
then choke on words id always hide
you and your charm creep closer
your gonna wish you never had met me
why am i seeking approval
ovunque vai
it's so cold out here in your wilderness
we aint ever gonna know
maybe we're already defeated
of the earth for you
if i'm wrong i am right
i know you've always been
lose yourself in time
you get the people and the government
it was dark & i was over
when you're holding me
nobody's perfect
you get the brunt of it all
i hope that youre well
you're my scope everything everywhere
i'm tired of this empty house
let it be known that i tried
and im gonna make your head burn
it's where they make you feel powerful
i will beg & i'll steal i will borrow
hello from the other side
every feeling every word
the harder that i try i regress
and you're my hope you're my despair
i feel like my life is flashing by
i will feel the power
couldnt stay away i couldnt fight it
never woulda seen the trouble that im in
and neon lights and waiting papers
before we realized
high tides high tides high tides
and now i've had enough of love
drink it all away ooh ooh ooh
every day feels like the road im on
don't patronize
that i wouldn't do
you think we would and we do
is on your case
how do i feel so mighty small
no doubt in my mind
but at least when youre at your worst
i still care
youre half me and youre half daddy
feel the earth move and then
even in the daylight when you think that
i promise im worthy mm
and gets me into my favorite mood
im trying to be brave
if you've got someone else
so i can breathe you in
but you won't no you won't
next time ill be braver
sat by the river & it made me complete
as you tear your way right through me
when night comes and i'm all on my own
you close the door
every time he aint here
theres no way i
i want your heaven and your ocean's too
ive never known this never before
so i can finish what has begun
'cause you don't care hmm
to tell you i'm sorry
i can't help myself from looking for you
with your loving there aint nothing
when i was young
youre my scope everything everywhere
when was the last time you thought of me
harder baby harder baby harder baby
you've been on my mind
nobodys perfect
when it crumbles
if this is aint love then what is
every place
hello its me
cause who wants to be right as rain
but now i only soak up wine
tried my best
ain't it funny how the mighty fall
will i ever get there
to be loved & love at the highest count
love you for free each other for free
don't look back at this crumbling fool
cause i need some substance in my life
and if i stay ill be alive
and i aint asking for forgiveness
he said to hold my breath to sit & wait
he will choose the poison over me
you're my light you're my darkness
you had my heart inside your hand
but im no good at doing it well
if youre ready i am ready
i feel my heart begin to burst & bleed
it was just like a song
ive been looking for you baby
you know i know just how you feel
just hold me closly
didn't i do it right did i let you down
i'd do it all again like i did it
and though your hair
wait do you see my heart on my sleeve
but if i
now that its over
when i fell off your mind
didnt get the chance to
you make me feel like i am free again
nothing compares no worries or cares
weve gotta let go of all of our ghosts
didn't get the chance to
learning to fly learning to run
its harder when youre on top
alright then i'm ready
ye that's it honey
favoritism ain't my thing but
i'm happy & unhappy too
so stand beside the river you cried
but not in this way
so come on & give me the chance
devotion
i'm blue da ba dee da ba daa
dont you know ive fallen for you
cause we had time against us
i know that its wrong
but the higher we climb
put a kiss on top of your head
pulls me down turns me weak for you
hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
he can't do it on his own
if you'd consider what we shared
yeah thats it honey
i don't know why i'm scared
i thought i told you hed be home soon
but i'm no good at doing it well
say what's on your mind
its like a ride that i want to get off
at least i know hes lying still
and that would make you go ay yi yi
let me stay here for just one more night
i promise i'm worthy mm
bursting at the seams no doubt
all i want is for you to be mine
that i will choose i will lose
i'll be home soon i won't be late
and i wonder
if you want me to stop ill freeze
but its in my roots its in my veins
that's what you said when you left me
you make me feel like i am home again
i guess were like water and a flame
it's hard to hold onto who i am
theres a fire starting in my heart
i know deep down inside
so where you been then dont go all coy
im the only one in love
i hope that you're well
and everything you do's a game
and i will always love you
let it burn 
but if i cant have you
from people i dont even know
sometimes it lasts in love
come on and give me the chance
cause it will never hurt
swept away im stolen
cause he wont go
we were born and raised
just hold on
and i'm forever excusing your intentions
i'm tired of trying
let time be patient you
you said im stubborn and i never give in
so who want to be right as rain
oi i feel like you dont love me
like im the one for you
so thats it
of when we were young
you get excitement in your bones
and himself and everybody around
over every border and on every line
there is no simple
'cause i knew that that was
don't try to change my mind
cry your heart out cry yeah
i know that you've been hurt before
or would it be a waste
you tease me with your control yeah
i've cried my heart out
we're willing to take the risk
im being cruel to be kind
make your dreams come true
when night comes and i'm on my own
oh if only if only you knew
stop trying to be somebody else
four cold walls without parole
we've both know we ain't kids no more
and i'm counting on you on you
cause heart break and hearts wait
but i just feel really lonely
because i'm too crazy for you
turned my sorrow into treasured gold
i felt the earth beneath my feet
and it's been that way to long
im a red hot mama but im blue for you
right now i truly hate being me
when the night keeps you from sleeping
don't you like me
that i give in to my pretendings
fool that i am
i quit i'm movin' on
when the day is done
ye thats it honey
it blew me away
i hear your words you made up
you make me feel like i am fun again
i love me now like i love him
its hard to hold onto who i am
i miss the air i miss my friends
i wish nothing but the best for you
breathe out
and watched you wave
it's no secret
who wants to be riding high
i give as good as i get
that's why i can't love you in the dark
and i'll tread any dangerous road
there ain't no room for things to change
itll clean your face
go ahead and still my heart
cause i want you so bad
euna vita che cercando a te
ill be somebody different
then choke on words i'd always hide
i feel like a ghost ooh ooh ooh
teetering on the edge of heaven & hell 
you say boo ive known you longer my dear
my life had no color before i met you
to self inflict that pain
something real something that feels true
what if i lose my heart and fail the 
we were born & raised in a summer haze
that's why you feel so insecure
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
youre the only one that i wanted
at the mention of my name
but if by chance youre here alone
i guess i still care
so i can show you that i was wrong
so i won't go i can't do it on his own
when the world seems so cruel
doesn't tear you apart anymore
you said i'm crazy
hold me closer one more time
it all it all it all
even started lying to you
so why don't we go
i wasn't ready then i'm ready now
are running out of time
oh honey if im not the one for you
i didn't know a single word he said
i would rather stay home on my own
is there anything i can do for you dear
ive imagined it all
you told me you were ready
for you too dont forget me
or will he go back to the place where
ooh ooh ooh ooh
i guess we're like water and a flame
lord dont let me i said lord dont let me
anyone else like i like you right
i was so scared to face my fears
cause there's many shades of black
all that i have is on the floor
she she aint real
ive known it from the moment that we met
and boy she's bringing you down
sitting on the sea
without me knowing
or dont you remember
i'll never learn if i never leap
trust me i've learned it
i've been searching
every single thing could blow my mind
even though my hands are tied
aint like you to hold back
you're still not mentioning love
i came across a fallen tree
cause you possess powers i cant fight
all of my life i've been frozen
if only if only you knew 
who want to be right as rain
but every time that you text
for breaking your heart
even if it leads nowhere
i promise im worth it mm
ive never seen the sky this color before
excuse me first love but were through
we were both right
yet i dont know anybody
this love has dried up and stayed behind
i know some clothes you left behind
the other night
sometimes i just feel it's only me
i swear im dead in the eyes ooh ooh ooh
by putting ideas in our heads
maybe you'll see
maybe youll see
our hearts break and hearts wait
i beg ill remember you say
aint it funny how the mighty fall
always make a mess of everything
mornin' will come & i'll do what's right
didnt i do it right
i'll put my hands up
just hold hold on
you're driving me away
cause i heard it screaming out your name
i quit now
i have a girlfriend and she is so blue
if you got someone else
shows that we are united
plus he's there for you
but now i give up
forgive me first love but i'm too tired
it turns out it aint enough
i'm being cruel to be kind
send my love to your new lover
i was running you were walking
mamas got a lot to learn teach me
we couldve had it all
you make me feel like i am clean again
ive been searching
so i hope i learn to get over myself
and my back begins to tingle
i know you've got things to do i do too
thats it
like i know you wanna
im hanging by a thread
'cause who wants to be right as rain
when i was a child
of your loving arms
out of her head she sang
i want to be lost in you
but that was a million years ago
to nurture what i've done
i aint lost just wandering
could've had it all
and youre my hope youre my despair
i grow fonder every day
but we do
these days when i see you
love love oh
i braved a hundred storms to leave you
and not just survive
did you ever make it out of that town
i'll be better for you
you say i've known you longer my dear
ive waited here for you
so go easy on me
look up to the sky not just the floor
for a million years
mamas got a lot to learn its heavy
there ain't no gold in this river
consistency is the gift to give for free
of a person we dont even like
just let time be patient you
oh my god i cant believe it
oh im so mad im getting old
i was too strong you were trembling
it's not my rejection
don't pretend that you don't want me
'cause i knew that that was 
im movin on
by choices that somebody else makes
but you'd save the best for last
i know this is love but
didnt i do it right did i let you down
i'd settle for a busy tone
with a beating
i'll be better to you
i love your dad cause he gave you to me
i cant face your breaking heart
with every feeling and every word
and hope that you find the missing piece
i beg ill remember you said
i ain't yours for no taking
i'd build myself up
to turning tables
its calling me home its calling me home
it makes me reckless
ive never been more scared
i can't keep up with your turning tables
if you just hold on
you must be mistaken
only yesterday was the time of our lives
are throwing wild and free
i'll always love you
cause when hard work don't pay off
baby dont let the lights go down
without one dollar to my name
and it is key
who's truly satisfied
pacing floors & opening doors
not that i care i don't care
i'd go black & blue
the heavens cried
if you refuse to activate
hoping you're someone i used to know
dont patronize
and i threw us into the flames
nothing that i wouldnt do
but i wont go i cant do it on my own
but sometimes it hurts instead yeah
from the moment
we almost fall apart & burn up easy
you and i have history
to when you were there
this aint easy its not meant to be
on the rolling sea
i'm going back to where i started
and i'm gonna make your head burn
'cause there's a side to you
but as time goes on & my age gets older
i get excitement in my bones
just a vague & broken boy instead
but you're cold to the core
i have nothing to feel no more
baby don't let the lights go down
you just hold on
when we were younger and free
just in case it hasn't gone
all that i say you always say more
im finding it hard to be here sincerely
ticking by your call
but i want to have fun
i realized what i wanted wasn't there
rolling in the deep
a jaw dropper
though i do know how you play
no we ain't kids no more
i didn't know quite what to do
so come on & give me a chance
im as lost now as i was back then
i want your heaven & your ocean's too
id go crawling down the avenue
like um i feel a bit confused 
how come we've both become a version
and even then you don't get far
like him inside & outside
whenever i'm standing my own ground
but my knees were far too weak
and if you have a minute why don't we go
sooth me so
you think we would and we do 
and boy you're bringing me down
youre like a dream come true
might just open up and swallow me whole
when night comes & your all on your own
im over my head
but because of that period of time
hey hey hey hey
fed up of biding your time
why would i put that on you
everybody here is watching you
now that all the dust has settled
to make me cry again
and i swear you moved overseas
but now the sky has cleared & it's blue
they melt my heart to stone
its not my rejection
when youre holding me
this would taste
when you don't
tell me you love me
when i am drowning in this silence
it's so hard to digest
i could offer you a warm embrace
we could have had it all
down with me
id go black and blue
so i wont go i cant do it on his own
theres so many shades of black
when night comes & i'm on my own
you would always win always win
just hold me close don't patronize
couldve had it all
there's a fire starting in my heart
if you dont
i begged you to let me in
no there's nothing
my hands they're strong
of our glory days
but despite the truth that i know
you better pull me to the light
i wont let you close enough to hurt me
what if i lose my heart & fail the 
e'una vita che cercando a te
take it as it comes
cause theres many shades of black
whered you go when you stayed behind
put your hand in my hand
and you showed up
alright then im ready
oh i hold you for a million years
but we do but we do but we do but we do
and on the highway of regret
and all i can do is watch and cry
i wish i could live a little more
ta da da da ta da da da yes i
a girl like you ain't meant to go away
i dont care how deep or shallow yeah
do you wrong
all of my life ive been frozen
i'm over my head
turning tables yeah
my heart speaks in puzzle and codes
if youd just let me in your life
even though it was so much fun
dont forget me i beg
when no one knows what its like to be us
we ain't ever gonna know
and lay yourself down
turning oh
so come on and give me the chance
so is it over
i can't bear this time
well it burned while i cried
i cant love you in the dark
this is how the story went
but that's your projection
dont patronize me
you cant deny how hard i have tried
i fall short each time
i could stay there
you're all that i need
feel you here forever
but go on & take it take it all to you
come down and waste away with me
that we met
but i aint done much healing
you set me free oh
you are still strong
sometimes the hole you left hurts
nothing that i wouldn't do
so i can start to begin whats begun
the storms are raging on the rolling sea
you can find him sittin on your doorstep
theres so many ways to act
turn down the bed
before its too late
but i ain't done much healing
so close yet still far away
so that's it
dropped you off at the train station
you aint seen nothing
are you crazy woman like me
it's better when something is wrong
youre still strong are still strong
im so hard to impress
did i let you down
please don't fall apart
oh oh oh oh
but your not answering the phone
you had my heart inside of your hand
go on go on & take it take it all to you
if this aint love then what is
when you'll just crumble back on down
yes i do and always loved you
but i will never do you wrong
now im resemblance to the man i met
in these crazy times i hope to find 
to make us grow from dust
im a fool but they all think im blind
where it felt something die
id do it all again like i did it
as far as i'm concerned
life was a party to be thrown
about the things i cant control
you take it all with my love
i dont want you at all
ill be better to you
oh honey if i'm not the one for you
just the guitar
like you want to like you want
see if i cry
i can't love you in the dark
hitting me like an explosion
and theres many shades of black
thats what you said when you left me
who regrets the things they've done
under haunted skies i see you ooh
and well stand
if you'd just let me in your life
i really thought the pain would pass
i set fire to the rain
shows that we aint gonna take it
sometimes i just feel its only me
ain't like you to hold back
it is the world to me
just take it take it all to you
and have you tell me 
when the pain cuts you deep
god only knows why it's taken me
i love you a million percent
he lends his coat for shelter
so i can start to begin what's begun
i wont make the same mistake again
so that's it baby
i wanna step into your great unknown
pave me a path to follow
i promise im worthy 
i beg i'll remember you say
god only knows what were fighting for
so tell me when you're gonna let me in
turn down the lights
to say goodnight
you say ive known you longer my dear
you grace me with your cold shoulder
and leave me
no theres nothing
'cause i love you
oy im tired
see when hard work dont pay off
is everything really meant to change
say it aint so say it aint so
'cause i want you so bad
if this is my last night with you
see if i shed a single sorry tear
and i hear your words that i made up
found myself today singing out your name
is a battle that i cannot fight
finally could this be it or
oh i hope in time hope in time
theres never been a better time
looking back i don't regret a thing
i will leave my heart at the door
you know i'll always mean
i say we've only known each other a year
the last time the last time
and no one had blame
but i won't go i can't do it on my own
i know you havent made your mind up yet
you're the right kind of madness
alone and face to face
but you played it with a beating
to stand in your arms
it's so cold in your wilderness
ill be waiting
now some other man will get
i mustve called a thousand times
just thinking of your face
havent you heard the rumors
do you still care
oh my god i can't believe it
i've never been more scared
keeping me from harm
i could offer you
since i thought of you
and its been that way to long
i want you to be my keeper
standing there
i thought i told you he'd be home soon
where you go i go
the more i do the less i know
but we do but we do but we do
there was just memories in a big storm
and it's teasing me
just what im hoping for
down down down down
and its teasing me
i've known it
you can't deny how hard i have tried
favoritism aint my thing but
thats why i cant love you in the dark
with every feeling & every word
to the way you move
just for you
no feeling is a waste
mama's got a lot to learn it's heavy
when youll just crumble back on down
but youre cold to the core
you made me want you
ooh the people i've met yea
so that we know that it hurts
just hold on just hold on
'cause i can't make you love me
face it all together
and dream about you
might just open up & swallow me whole
im a red hot mama but you white and cold
cause we are living worlds apart
oh i'm so mad i'm getting old
were willing to take the risk
she she ain't real
when love is a game for fools to play
ill put my hands up
cry your heart out
cause ive been here before
there aint no room for things to change
like i dont really know what im doing
to forget your past and simply be mine
filling rooms with all my hopes & fears
why should anything about it be fair
is blowing in your face
i promise you will see
favoritism ain't my thing but 
to scratch my itch & beat my drum
my god this reminds me
baby i quit now
whenever im alone with you
to make you feel my love
if i am i'm crazy for you
so come on and give me a chance
i want your heaven and your oceans too
and if im not the one for you
turn down these voices inside my head
don't need to think it over
and ill do whats right
but it's you who makes me lose my head
feel the earth move & then
you make me feel like i am whole again
one i never looked for
just a vague and broken boy instead
that's it
i'm giving you up
go at your own pace
somewhere only we know
youre gonna wish you never had met me
i won't rise until this battle's won
stop drowning in wait
shows that we ain't gonna take it
'cause then i don't see
without the security
in every face that ive ever known
looking back i dont regret a thing
i've made up my mind
you think we would & we do 
in case it is the last time
'cause i need some substance in my life
i didn't give to you
it was dark and i was over
and who are you hiding from
i had good intentions
i won't stand by you
but it dont matter it clearly
i am so tired of battling with myself
i wont rise until this battles won
i cant help myself from looking for you
i thought of me i want to see
but when the pain cuts you deep
but i won't go
i'd go black and blue
i can't go back to the river
to go over everything
or should i just keep chasing pavements
i'm happy and unhappy too
to earn my stripes i'd have to pay
there aint no gold in this river
no doubt in my mind where you belong
whichever road i choose youll go
no one has me like you do baby
all my friends keep on telling me that 
when you don't ooh don't
maybe baby im just losing my mind 
i hoped you'd see my face
i didnt give to you
when it fell something died
'cause mine sure won't be shared
'cause i only want to be the cure
i wish i could lay down beside you
a most turbulent period of my life
its been there for days on end and
mmh mmh mhm
i can't take another defeat
strips me down bare
baby i have no story to be told
i've been trying my whole life to solve
oh oh oh
excuse me first love but we're through
two hours late
i can take a lot
when we spoke yesterday
the sweetest devotion ive known
god only knows why its taken me
but sometimes it hurts instead
you disappear one day
oooohhhh
but loving you was a breakthrough
i know i'm not the only one
is exactly what it seems
all this sorrow & this pain
when will i begin to feel like me again
i'm holdin' on barely
so why dont we just play pretend
but go on & take it take it all with you
i know its hard but its not
hoping youre someone i used to know
so why don't we just play pretend
the way im running with you honey
you could've had it all
under your thumb i cant breathe
waiting for a surprise
it illuminates all of my doubts
i often think about where i went wrong
havent made
i should have known
i walked across an empty land
is the subject of their talk
oh so i hope i learn to get over myself
yet i don't know anybody
on your face
