# TryHackMe OpenVPN Troubleshooting Script

### Script to troubleshoot connectivity to the TryHackMe network using OpenVPN on Linux.
Usage:
* Download the `thm-troubleshoot` script. Saving it to the same place as your OpenVPN configuration pack (`~/Downloads` by default) is advisable, but not essential.
* In your Linux terminal, make the script executable with `chmod +x <path-to-script>`. If you downloaded the script to your Downloads folder, this will be `chmod +x ~/Downloads/thm-troubleshoot`.
* Run the script by typing `sudo` followed by the path to the script into your terminal and pressing enter. If the script is in your downloads, it will be the following command: `sudo ~/Downloads/thm-troubleshoot`.
* The script will instruct you on how to proceed from there.

**Disclaimer -- this script is designed to work on Kali, Ubuntu, or other Debian based systems to solve basic OpenVPN errors. If you're using a non-recommended distribution then it is assumed that you can also troubleshoot these errors manually** 

Any question or issues (or if connectivity problems persist), please ask in the [TryHackMe Discord server](https://discord.gg/F7ERYzz).
Happy Hacking!
